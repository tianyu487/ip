# littleDaisy

littleDaisy is a friendly desktop task manager that keeps todos, deadlines, and
events in a local data file. See the [User Guide](docs/README.md) for the full
command reference.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, run `./gradlew run` from the project root. If the setup is correct,
   the littleDaisy window will open.

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

## Running littleDaisy

- Run the JavaFX interface with `./gradlew run` (macOS/Linux) or `gradlew.bat run` (Windows).
- Run the original text interface from `LittleDaisy.main()` in the IDE.
- Run tests and coding-standard checks with `./gradlew check`.
- Build the executable fat JAR with `./gradlew shadowJar`; the output is `build/libs/littleDaisy.jar`.
